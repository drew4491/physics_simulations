# physics_simulations
Various projects completed during my time at UBC in the Physics department before graduating.  These include projects from PHYS 210 - Introduction to Computational Physics and PHYS 410 - Computational Physics

There is a total of five projects from phys 210 all done in Python, these include:

1: Differential Equation Solving for Ballistics <br/>
2: Ferromagnetism, (2D ising model, code is fairly sloppy but it works and produces animations to demonstrate the effect of temperature on magnetism)<br/>
3: Resonance<br/>
4: Kinetic Theory of Gases (this code also creates an animation  but for some reason it doesnt work anymore)<br/>
5: Heat Distribution (this project shows a 2d heat map of heat distribution over time, if the conditions are not set properly the animation will break)<br/>

This was the first course I had taken in python and only the second course overall in coding.<br/>

The next projects were created in PHYS 410 at UBC. These two projects were fairly extensive and required a lot of mathematical equations to be solved and then converted into code in MATLAB.  The projects completed are:

1: Simulation of two Galaxies colliding in 2D<br/>
2: The Schrodinger equation with a simulation on how different initial conditions and potentials affect the wave function and how it travels. It demonstrates a potential well and potential wall and also demonstartes the double slit experiment.

The code may be used by others but please source anything you use.
