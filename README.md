# physics_simulations
Various projects completed during my time at UBC in the Physics department before graduating.  These include projects from PHYS 210 - Introduction to Computational Physics and PHYS 410 - Computational Physics

There is a total of five projects from phys 210, these include:

1: Differential Equation Solving for Ballistics
2: Ferromagnetism, (2D ising model, code is fairly sloppy but it works and produces animations to demonstrate the effect of temperature on magnetism)
3: Resonance
4: Kinetic Theory of Gases (this code also creates an animation)
5: Heat Distribution (this project shows a 2d heat map of heat distribution over time, if the conditions are not set properly the animation will break)

This was the first course I had taken in python and only the second course overall in coding.
